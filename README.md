# The-Python-Restaurant-Project

A simple command-line application simulating a restaurant ordering system built in Python. The app allows users to view a menu, place an order by selecting items, and displays the total cost of the order.

## Features
- Display Menu: Shows a list of available food and drink items with their prices.
- Order Items: Users can order items by entering the name of each dish.
- Calculate Total: Calculates and displays the total amount for the ordered items.
- Repeat Ordering: Allows users to continue adding items until they choose to stop.

## Error Handling
- Item Not Found: If an item is not on the menu, the app informs the user that the item is not available.
